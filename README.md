# DSA and OOP Concepts in Java

This repository serves as a learning and revision resource for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of Java code examples and explanations for DSA and OOP topics. It covers fundamental concepts, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

Each concept is explained in a concise manner, and corresponding Java code examples are provided to illustrate their implementation. The code is designed to be easy to understand, making it suitable for learning and revision purposes.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized into separate folders for each DSA and OOP concept. Within each folder, you will find Java source code files (.java) that demonstrate the implementation and usage of the respective concept. Accompanying explanations and comments are provided within the code.


## Usage

To use this repository for learning and revision, simply navigate to the specific concept or topic you are interested in. Each folder contains a Java file that demonstrates the implementation of that concept. Open the file, read the comments and explanations, and run the code to observe the concept in action.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of the concepts.
